# Political-Districting-Problem
Demonstrating the Detrimental Effects of Gerrymandering with Mathematical Programming

## ABSTRACT

  Redrawing electoral district boundaries has been studied since the
  60's in several democratic countries, particularly the USA. The
  major concern in political redistricting is gerrymandering, the
  manipulation of a district's boundaries in favor of a political
  party or group. In order to prevent unfair political advantage and
  propose fair representation, the political districting literature
  has introduced several criteria such as population equality,
  contiguity, and compactness. This study develops two new
  mixed-integer mathematical programming formulations to
  quantitatively demonstrate the detrimental result of this practice
  on the political balance \textit{even when} these constraints have
  been operationalized to inhibit gerrymandering. Single-member and
  mixed single- and multi-member district electoral systems are used
  in the formulations. The d'Hondt method is applied for
  proportionality representation in the mixed-member district
  formulation. To test our claim, we obtain computational results
  using the 2015 Istanbul general election and the 2017 constitutional
  referendum data. Considering our claim and the formulations to
  validate it, the study is the first of its kind to the best of our
  knowledge.
